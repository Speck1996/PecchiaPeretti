\chapter{User Interface Design}\label{c:gui}
The general guideline to develop the user interface for the client applications is too keep the interface as simple as possible while providing all the needed functionalities.\\
The style used to build the user interface mockups is based on the Material Design by Google, however those mockups serve purely as a guideline for the development of the interface. As stated in the RASD, the final product style may differ from them, but the provided functionalities must be the same.
To have a better idea of how the user interface will look like when the applications will be finished please refer to the section 3.1.1 of the RASD.
