Software engineering 2 project (mandatory part + implementation and testing)

The goal of the project's mandatory part is to write the Requirement Analysis and Specification Document (RASD) and the Design Document (DD) of Data4Help, a WebApp which simulates a data hub for health monitoring devices.

The optional part of the project involved developing as many features as possible of the whole application and the Implmentation and Test Document (ITD) whose scope is to describe the code structure and comparing it with the features and the design choices described in the RASD and the DD.

The final part of the project involved testing another implementation of the Data4Help app developed by another group and writing the Acceptance Test Deliverable (ATD).
