\section{Other Aspects}



\subsection{Quality of Code}

The structure of the code is well defined, although the code itself lacks some comments, making it not so easy to understand at a first glance. 

The Javadoc while not being totally complete for methods and attributes, well describes the classes present in the code.


\subsection{Github Repository}

The organization of the Github Repository is a bit messy, a better folder managing would have been appreciated.


\subsection{Data simulation}

The graph representation of the simulated data is well done. The idea itself of simulating individual's data is a good idea, even if it lead to some problems with thread handling.
