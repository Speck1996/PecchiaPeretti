\section{Adopted frameworks}

The project has been developed with the programming language Java, using several specifications of Java EE 8.
In particular the following specification have been adopted:

\begin{itemize}
\item Servlet 4.0
\item EJB 3.2
\item JPA 2.2
\item JTA 1.2
\item JAX-RS 2.1
\item JSF 2.3
\item Managed Bean 1.0
\end{itemize}
The Java EE 8 specifications are implemented by the application server Glassfish 5.

For the geocoding service provided by the manager an external API was used: Nominatim API. 
The choice of this API was based on the fact that is the only one entirely open source, and that doesn't require any subscription or payment even if it has a strong limitation on the requests that can be made in a certain amount of time and a documentation only based on javadoc.
For more information please consider reading Nominatim Policies linked in the references section.

Moreover, an Android application has been developed, again by means of the Java programming language.
The frameworks used by the Android App are all part of the android native package with the exception of Retrofit 2.5. This APIs makes the handling of HTTP communication with the server faster, with its integrated API parsing response.
