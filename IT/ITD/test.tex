\section{Testing}


\subsection{System test cases}
Once the development of the server and of the webapp have been overall completed, several manual test cases have been performed. In particular, the following use cases have been successfully tested:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Third party login.
\item Third party signup.
\item Submission of a new individual data request.
\item Submission of a new group data request.
\item Visualization of all the submitted requests (either individual and group)
\item Visualization of the data of the group request (when sufficiently numerous to be anonymized) and individual request (if accepted by the individual).
\item Subscription and deletion of requests (either individual and group).
\end{enumerate}
