\section{External Interface Requirements}


\subsection{Hardware Interfaces}
Data4Help is a software application, therefore no hardware interface is needed. However the application needs a smartphone with working bluetooth and internet in order to guarantee its primary services (collecting and updating eHealth data from user devices). 
In addition, the AutomatedSOS service requires that the users' smartphone has location services enabled.


\subsection{Software Interfaces}
In order to guarantee a quick development Data4Help system will use the following external services:
\begin{itemize}
\item DataBase engine : this service will be used to manage all users data and satisfy third party queries
\item Map: individuals with AutomatedSOS service will be able to see the live position of their ambulance whenever a rescue procedure is activated.
\end{itemize}

\section{Scenarios}
\subsection{Scenario 1}

Rebecca has worked very hard in the last months and she has been a long stressful periods. Recently she had to skip several working days because she didn't feel very well. 
She consulted her doctor John who didn't notice anything alarming.
John recently discovered Data4Help and he thinks that it could be useful to monitor the health status of Rebecca on daily basis for the next weeks.
Then, John asked Rebecca to register to Data4Help and to use her smartwatch to collect some data.
Rebecca immediately registered to the service and accepted the request that John sent to her.
Now John can have a better look at his patient's health status and can make better diagnosis.


\subsection{Scenario 2}
Walter is a 75 years old man who lives alone in a small town.
His doctor has been monitoring him thanks to Data4Help because he has a cardiac disease.
Last week, Walter was at the supermarket and suddenly he fainted. Luckily, the store was crowded and therefore someone helped him and called an ambulance.
He is afraid it could happen again and because he lives alone, he decides to activate the AutomatedSOS service.


\subsection{Scenario 3}
FatBit is a startup that wants to launch its first wearable. To optimize their limited resources and to improve their ads, Fatbit's managers want to know wich are the countries with healtier people,wich one have the more active, and the average age of their potential consumers. Collecting this data it's not easy, especially when joining the market for the first time. Fortunately a new service, Data4Help, has just launched and one of its main features it's the distribution of eHealth data, organized according to different parameters, included the ones FatBit managers are interested in (age,location,steps taken daily).
Therefore FatBit's managers decide to register with a unique account as third-party, and start their data analysis thanks to Data4Help.


\subsection{Scenario 4}
Wile is an engineering student who wants to get back in shape. He decides to join the gym and to buy a wearable to see its progress over time. Initially Wile is satisfied by his wearable and the built in application but later he starts noticing that more and more wearables with improved design and many new features are launching in the market. Wisely, he notice that the built in application collects the data only for the producer's devices and so if he wanted to change his wearable without losing data he were pratically forced to buy a new watch from the same company. Therefore he decides to use Data4Help, allowing him to change his wearable with the one he likes the most without losing data.
